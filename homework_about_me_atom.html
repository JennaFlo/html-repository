<h1>How to make a lampwork bead</h1>
  <p>My name is Jennifer Flores and I am an artist working with the medium of glass. My main mean of creation is using a lampworking torch to
melt glass rods that I can reshape into bead, small figures, and functional pieces. I work with my materials at <a href="http://thirddegreeglassfactory.com/" target="__blank">Third Degree Glass Factory</a> in St.Louis, MO.

  <h2>Steps to making a glass bead<h2>
    <p>Before you start, here is a list of things we need to begin:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Glass rods with COE 104</li>
    <li>Glass mandrels</li>
    <li>Bead release</li>
    <li>Shaping tools: knife, scissors, patterning sheers, etc.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2> Prep Work</h2>
    <p> Before you begin to work with glass, its very important that you start gathering your supplies and setting up your work station</p>
    <p>Things you will make you to set up</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mandrels: Dip the ends of the mandles into the bead release</li>
      <li>Water: Make sure you fill the heat-resistant cup with water for under your torch</li>
      <li>Safety: Wear an apron and protectant eyewear</li>
      <li>Tools: Place your tools on the side of the torch of your dominant hand </li>
      <li>Kiln: start your kiln at the proper annealing cycle</li>
    </ul>

<h2>1.Turn on your torch</h2>
  <p>When turning on your torch, make sure that you are using the proper safety techniques for the studio in which you are working. Some studios allow independnat artists
to use their own strikers, while others require you use studio-issues materials like flint strikers to start your torch. Either way, make sure that you work with the proper order
when it comes to your torch: <em>Propane is turned on and lit first, while oxygen is added to the flame after the propane is ignited</em></p>

<h3>P.O.O.P</h3>
  <p>Always remember this when you are working with gases and your torch</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Propane</li>
    <li>Oxygen</li>
    <li>Oxygen</li>
    <li>Propane</li>
  </ul>
  <p>PO on and OP off!</p>

<h2>2.Cook your Mandrels</h2>
  <p>After you dip your mandrels in the bead release, they must dry on the mandrel. Make sure that you see the color change in the surface of the mandrel before you start
the next step. The color will chaneg to a lighter shade of the wet bead release. You can compare them if you like.One the bead release is dry, you then want to
take your mandrels into the back of teh flame and slowly rotate the mandle away from you and you moved the rod closer to the middle, or heart, of the flame. As
you get closer to the head of the torch the temperature in the flame will increase, and and you roll the mandrel you will create a baked effect around the mandrel with the
bead release acting as a protecting layer between the metal of the mandle and the glass of the bead. This allows for the glass to cool in the kiln and not adhere to the
metal of the mandrel</p>

<h2>3.Flash your glass</h2>
  <p>After your bead release is cooked on the mandrel, its time to start flashing your glass to make it melt. In the same way you cooked your bead release, you will introduce
your glass rod into the back of the flame. Move the rod in and out of the flame, back and forth, or up and down like you are drumming the air above and below the flame.
As the rod heats up, the end of the glass in the flame will start to glow a redish-orange color. As you heat up the rod, the glass will become viscus at the end in the flame
When the glass is starting your drip, you are ready to start adding it to your mandrel.</p>

<h2>4.Add your glass to the mandrel</h2>
  <p>As the glass in the flame becomes viscus, you when to bring your mandrel with the bead-release baked on, into the flame. With the glass rod held at a perpendicular angle
to the flame, start to lay the glass on the bead release, while spinning the mandrel away from the flame. As the mandrel spins, teh glass from the rod will wrap around the
bead release and start to form a bead. Once you have added enough glass to your mandrel, dope the mandrel below the flame and use the flame to "cut" the tail between the
glass rod and the bead</p>

<h2>5.Shape your bead</h2>
  <p>Most of the shaping of the bead takes place out of the flame. By nature, glass wants to be round, but as you add glass to the mandrel, the pushing and pulling of
the material slightly makes the glass off center on the mandrel. Allow gravity to do the work as the bead is heated to red hot in the flame, move the bead and mandrel out
of the flame and start to roll the mandrel away from you. As you spin, you will see the bead begins to form a more circular shape. If the bead gets too mishapen, you
can reintroduce it to the flame, slowly from the back to the middle of the flame, spinning the mandrel as you go, reshaping it when it gets to the melting point. </p>

<h2>6.Annealing your bead</h2>
  <p>When you are satisfied with the shape of your bead, its time to take the bead to the kiln. The kiln will take time to heat up, and that is why we started it in the cycle
during our prep time. By the time you finish your first bead, you should be about 20 minutes into the kiln cycle. Usually, the kiln will run for the length or your cycle at
the 970 temperature for soft glass (COE 104). The kilns hold at that temperature for around 8 hours. The entire cycle including cool-down lasts for about 12 hours.
<br> When you add your bead to the kiln, make sure to lift the door and slide your mandrel into the kiln as far as possible, with keeping a hand's worth length of the
mandrel hanging out of the kiln for movement purposed. As more beads get added to the kiln, mandrels can be consoldiated and moved to the side of the kiln to
make more room for others.</p>

<h2>7. Finishing your bead</h2>
  <p>Many people may think that your are finsihed with your bead once it leaves the kiln. However, there are several more steps to take after the annealing process is
complete. <br>First, you need to get your beads off the mandrel. There are many techniques to do this, and depending on what type to bead you are making, more care
may need to be used at this point. Materials you will use will include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Needle-nose pliers</li>
<li>Diamond-tip reamer</li>
    <li>Metal file</li>
    <li>Grip pad</li>
    <li>Sandpaper</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some people will take all of their mandrels and leave them in a cup of water to help break down the bead release between the glass and the mandrel. This is a helpful
technique, especially with sculptural work. One the bead release meets water, the effect will <em>"melt away"</em>the bead release, freeing the bead to spin on the
mandrel. Once the bead is loose enough, you can slowly work the bead down the shaft and off the mandrel.<br> BUT....we are not finished yet</p>
  <p>After the bead is off the mandrel, we need to use the diamond-tip reamer to removed the bead release from inside the bead. Some people can actually use a
Dremel took to get the bead release free from the inside of the bead. Once the bead release is removed, rinse the bead once more. If you notice any sharp edges
on the bead, you can use the other tools: sand paper, file, cold-working tools. Once the bead is in perfect condition, you can place it on a necklace or other beadable
items and enjoy!</p>
